                <p>Originating from the need to have a custom line-based typeface for the open-source Arcticons
                    icon-pack, Arcticons Sans was created in 2021. With many updates in the years to come, the typeface
                    expanded. Becoming a standalone font with over 1100 glyphs, including support for over 100
                    languages.</p>
                <p>The monolinear look is based on the principle that it has to be easily scalable while working with
                    the typeface in the icon-pack. Each icon has the same line-width of 1px, and glyphs for the font
                    were designed to fit within an 8×14px rectangle. This all results in the semi-condensed bold look of
                    the typeface.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Over the years, it has received many updates with numerous fixes, thanks to all the volunteers who
                    helped to make this open-source typeface become what it is today.</p>
                <p>Arcticons Sans supports many OpenType features including contextual alternates which adjusts
                    punctuation depending on the shape of surrounding glyphs, tabular numbers, and much more.</p>
