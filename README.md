# The Arcticons Sans typeface

Originating from the need to have a custom line-based typeface for the open-source Arcticons icon-pack, Arcticons Sans was created in 2021. With many updates in the years to come, the typeface expanded. Becoming a standalone font with over **1100** glyphs, including support for over **100** languages. 

The monolinear look is based on the principle that it has to be easily scalable while working with the typeface in the icon-pack. Each icon has the same line-width of 1px, and glyphs for the font were designed to fit within an 8Ã—14px rectangle. This all results in the semi-condensed bold look of the typeface.

Over the years, it has received many updates with numerous fixes, thanks to all the volunteers who helped to make this open-source typeface become what it is today.

Arcticons Sans supports many OpenType features including contextual alternates which adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of surrounding glyphs, tabular numbers, and much more.
